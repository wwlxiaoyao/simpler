"""Host-side staging for post-fork zero-copy host buffers.

``submit_next_level`` calls ``_stage_host_buffers_for_chip_submit`` before any
dispatch. A ``create_host_buffer`` buffer is born-shared — its bytes already
live in the child-visible shm and the child writes results back into the same
pages — so staging copies in neither direction; it only validates that each
in-range view fits inside its buffer. These are pure host-side unit tests: they
inject the staging state directly and never fork, compile a kernel, or touch a
device. The end-to-end round-trip lives in the a2a3sim scene test.
