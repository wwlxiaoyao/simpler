/**
 * TensorMap — TensorKey → producer task slot mapping.
 *
 * At the hierarchical host level, every tensor is identified by a TensorKey
 * consisting of (ptr, worker_id). Host tensors (HeapRing) use
 * worker_id=-1 because their addresses are globally unique; child_memory
 * tensors use the owning NEXT_LEVEL worker id to disambiguate identical
 * device addresses across different children.
 *
 * Unlike the L2 PTO2TensorMap, this implementation:
 *   - Uses std::unordered_map (no ring buffer entry pool)
 *   - Does not perform overlap detection (each key maps to one producer)
 *   - Cleans up entries actively when a task is CONSUMED
 *
 * Owned exclusively by the Orchestrator (main thread); no locking required.
