/**
 * Scheduler — DAG scheduling engine.
 *
 * The Scheduler thread routes tasks through the DAG lifecycle:
 *   ready_queue → dispatch (via WorkerManager) → completion → fanout release → new ready
 *
 * Worker pool management (WorkerThread creation, idle selection, dispatch) is
 * delegated to WorkerManager. The Scheduler only drives the DAG state machine.
 *
 * Flow:
 *   Orch: submit() → ready_queue.push(slot) + cv.notify()
 *
 *   Scheduler thread:
 *     wait on cv (ready_queue OR completion_queue non-empty)
 *     drain completion_queue → on_task_complete → fanout release → ready_queue
 *     drain ready_queue → manager.pick_n_idle → dispatch
 *
 *   WorkerThread (managed by WorkerManager):
 *     loop: task_queue.pop() → endpoint.run(dispatch) →
 *           completion callback → Scheduler.worker_done(completion)
