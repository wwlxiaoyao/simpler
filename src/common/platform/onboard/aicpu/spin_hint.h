 * @brief Platform-specific spin-wait hint for AICPU (real hardware)
 *
 * On real Ascend hardware, AICPU runs on dedicated ARM A55 cores with sufficient
 * resources. No spin-wait hint is needed — the macro expands to a no-op.

// Wall-clock budget (ms) of no task progress before the dispatch loop aborts
// with PTO2_ERROR_SCHEDULER_TIMEOUT. On real hardware this must sit *below* the
// STARS AICore op-execution timeout (PLATFORM_OP_EXECUTE_TIMEOUT_US, 3 s) so the
// AICPU detects the hang and flushes its diagnostics (tensor dump, in-flight
// partial output) before STARS reaps the op and poisons the context. Chain:
// this < op-exec < host stream-sync (platform_config.h). Trade-off: 2 s is
// shorter than the worst distributed-init / HCCL skew #897 sized 5 s for, so a
// slow distributed startup can false-latch; if that bites, raise this together
// with the op-exec / stream-sync timeouts. The sim build keeps the full 5 s (no
// STARS to race). The runtime consumes it as SCHEDULER_TIMEOUT_MS (see
// scheduler_types.h).
