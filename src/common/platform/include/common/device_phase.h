/**
 * @file device_phase.h
 * @brief Fixed-cardinality AICPU run-phase timing, shared by host + AICPU + sim.
 *
 * The AICPU cannot write to the host log on its hot path (logging perturbs the
 * very timing we measure, and the AICore side has no log path at all). Instead
 * it stamps raw `get_sys_cnt_aicpu()` cycles into a host-allocated buffer whose
 * address rides on `KernelArgs::device_wall_data_base`; the host reads the
 * buffer back after the run and converts cycles → ns.
 *
 * This buffer holds a FIXED set of phases — each fires exactly once per run per
 * AICPU thread, so a plain indexed store (no ring, no rotation, no recycle)
 * suffices. That is the same model the original single run-wall pair used; this
 * just generalizes "one {start,end} pair" to "N_FIXED {start,end} pairs", with
 * AicpuPhase::RunWall keeping the original whole-run wall as slot 0.
 *
 * Variable-cardinality phases (per-submit, per-scheduler-loop, arbitrary
 * nesting) do NOT belong here — they need a rotating ring and live in the
 * L2 swimlane orch/sched pools instead.
 *
 * Layout per AICPU thread: AicpuPhaseRecord[NUM_AICPU_PHASES]. The buffer is
 * thread-major: thread t occupies records [t*NUM_AICPU_PHASES, (t+1)*N).
