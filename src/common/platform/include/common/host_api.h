/**
 * Host API function pointers for device memory operations.
 * Allows a runtime to use pluggable device-memory backends.
 *
 * This is a platform capability, not runtime state: the platform layer
 * (onboard / sim c_api_shared.cpp) builds one shared, const table of
 * context-free function pointers at load time and passes it by address into
 * bind_callable_to_runtime_impl / validate_runtime_impl. Each pointer recovers
 * its runner from a thread-local, so the single table is valid for every runner
 * and every run — it is not rebuilt per simpler_run. Shared by every runtime
 * variant (tensormap_and_ringbuffer / host_build_graph) and arch (a2a3 / a5) so
 * the field set stays defined in exactly one place.
