// Scope-stats collector — platform-owned, runtime-agnostic.
//
// Platform owns all collector state. Runtime calls pure-value APIs to report
// the task/heap ring start/end and tensormap usage at scope boundaries; no
// runtime types cross the boundary.
//
// Streaming transport (mirrors dep_gen): one ScopeStatsRecord is appended per
// scope boundary (begin and end) into a pooled ScopeStatsBuffer popped from the
// host-fed free_queue; full buffers are pushed onto the orchestrator thread's
// ready_queue. The host
// collector drains them in real time, so the effective record capacity is
// disk-bounded rather than the old fixed 16 384-entry ring.
//
// Setter symbols (set_scope_stats_enabled, set_platform_scope_stats_base)
// are exported unconditionally so the host-side sim DeviceRunner's dlsym
// always resolves.

// heap reclaim/allocation pointers, dep_pool_start/end = dep_pool tail/top.

//
// The heap ring's reclaim/alloc pointers are wrapping byte offsets in
// [0, heap_cap); subtracting two boundary snapshots therefore loses every wrap
// that happened in between, so the per-scope alloc / high-water deltas are not
// recoverable once a scope's heap throughput exceeds heap_cap. The runtime is
// the only place each individual wrap is observable (each allocation is
// < heap_cap, so a single wrap is unambiguous), so it reports each wrap here;
// the collector accumulates the count per ring and unrolls the sampled wrapping
// offsets into monotonic values, making every delta exact for any wrap count.
//
// The runtime passes only the side — it stores no per-ring state. The collector
// attributes the wrap to the current scope's ring (the wrap always happens mid
// scope, where the active ring equals the most recent scope_stats_begin's ring).
#define SCOPE_STATS_HEAP_SIDE_ALLOC 0    // heap_top (allocation pointer) wrapped.
