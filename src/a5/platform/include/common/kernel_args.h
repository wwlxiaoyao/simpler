/**
 * @file kernel_args.h
 * @brief KernelArgs payload - Shared between Host, AICPU, and AICore
 *
 * This structure is the Simpler runtime payload read by AICPU and AICore
 * kernels. It contains pointers to device memory for runtime data, profiling
 * buffers, and platform state.
 *
 * Platform Support:
 * - a5: Real hardware with CANN runtime compatibility
 * - a5sim: Host-based simulation using standard memory
 *
 * Memory Layout (a5):
 * This platform struct is the front-less per-task runtime payload, passed
 * directly to the onboard AICPU launch (rtsLaunchCpuKernel) and copied to
 * device memory for AICore — no CANN launch front is needed on this path.
 * The bootstrap dispatcher has its own private KernelArgs/DeviceArgs ABI in
 * src/common/aicpu_loader/device/aicpu_dispatcher.cpp.
 *
 * Memory Layout (a5sim):
 * For simulation, the layout is maintained for API compatibility, though
 * we use host memory instead of device memory.

 * Kernel arguments payload

 *
 * Field Access Patterns:
 * - runtime_args: Written by host, read by AICPU (task runtime, includes
 *   handshake buffers)
 * - dep_gen_data_base: Written by host platform, read by AICPU platform layer;
 *   zero when dep_gen capture is unused
 *
 * Consumer paths:
 *       - AICPU: receives this KernelArgs directly via rtsLaunchCpuKernel
 *       - AICore: receives device KernelArgs* via KERNEL_ENTRY
