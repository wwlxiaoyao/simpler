# Scheduler — DAG Dispatch Internals

The Scheduler is the **DAG executor**. A dedicated C++ thread that consumes
submitted slots, wires fanout edges, dispatches ready tasks to worker threads,
and handles completion callbacks. It is the bridge between the Orchestrator
(producer of DAG nodes) and the WorkerManager (consumer of ready nodes).

For the high-level role of the Scheduler among the three engine components,
see [hierarchical_level_runtime.md](hierarchical_level_runtime.md). For the DAG
construction side (what feeds the Scheduler), see
[orchestrator.md](orchestrator.md). For dispatch mechanics (how
`WorkerThread::dispatch` actually runs a task), see
[worker-manager.md](worker-manager.md).

---

## 1. Role

The Scheduler's job:

- Drain the **wiring queue** (Phase 0): wire fanout edges for newly
  submitted slots; if all producers are already done, promote to the ready queue.
- Drain the **ready queue** (Phase 1): for each ready slot, pick an idle
  `WorkerThread` from the appropriate pool and hand off.
- Drain the **completion queue** (Phase 2): for each worker completion,
  transition the slot to `COMPLETED` or `FAILED`, release fanout references,
  wake or poison downstream consumers, and (if all refs released) retire the
  ring slot.

One Scheduler per `Worker` instance, one thread per Scheduler. The Scheduler
**does not inspect task data** — it moves slot ids between queues and
consults scheduling metadata (`fanin_count`, `fanout_consumers`, `state`).

---

## 2. The queues

```cpp
class Scheduler {
    // Producer: Orchestrator.submit_*. Consumer: Scheduler's own loop, Phase 0.
    LockFreeQueue<WiringEntry> wiring_queue_;       // {slot, producers}

    // Strict-4 — per-worker-type ready queues.
    // Producers: Orchestrator.submit_* (routes by slot.worker_type) +
    //            Scheduler Phase 0 / Phase 2 (fanout-released; routes by
    //            consumer worker_type).
    // Consumer: Scheduler's own loop, Phase 1 (one drain loop per queue,
    //           each with its own head-of-line break).
    ReadyQueue *ready_next_level_queue_;
    ReadyQueue *ready_sub_queue_;

    // Producer: WorkerThread (on endpoint->run() return).
    // Consumer: Scheduler's own loop, Phase 2.
    std::queue<WorkerCompletion> completion_queue_;
};
```

### Wiring queue

Introduced so that `Orchestrator::submit_*` does not need to acquire
`fanout_mu` on every producer slot at submit time (see
[orchestrator.md](orchestrator.md) §2 step 6).

Each entry:

```cpp
struct WiringEntry {
    TaskSlot consumer;
    std::vector<TaskSlot> producers;    // producers this consumer depends on
};
```

### Ready queue

Slots whose `fanin_count == fanin_released` are ready to dispatch. The queue
holds just the slot id; dispatch reads task data from the
`ring.slot_state(sid)` pool.

**Strict-4 — per-worker-type split.** In practice the ready queue is two
`ReadyQueue` instances, one per `WorkerType`:

```cpp
ReadyQueue ready_next_level_queue_;   // WorkerType::NEXT_LEVEL tasks
ReadyQueue ready_sub_queue_;          // WorkerType::SUB tasks
```

Matching L2's per-shape ready queues (the shared MPMC `ready_queues[]` split
by AIC / AIV / MIX), with the L3+ exception that we use `std::queue`
(Allowed Exception 3: dynamic data structures on host) and only two
worker types (Allowed Exception 2: `NEXT_LEVEL` + `SUB` at L3+, not
AIC / AIV / MIX). `Orchestrator::submit_*` routes each slot to the queue
matching `slot.worker_type`; `Scheduler::on_task_complete` routes a
newly-ready consumer the same way, based on the *consumer's* worker
type. `Scheduler::dispatch_ready` drains each queue with its own
head-of-line break so a saturated pool of one type cannot stall dispatch
for the other.

### Completion queue

Endpoint completions whose worker returned or failed. Each
`WorkerCompletion` carries `{slot, group_index, outcome, error_message}`;
`outcome` is success, task failure, endpoint failure, or skipped. The
Scheduler runs completion handling (fanout release, downstream wake/poison,
try_consume) in its own thread so that WorkerThreads can immediately return to
their next task.

---

## 3. Scheduler loop (pseudocode)

```cpp
void Scheduler::run() {
    while (running_) {
        // Phase 0: wiring
        WiringEntry w;
        while (wiring_queue_.try_pop(w)) {
            wire_fanout(w);   // see §4
        }

        // Phase 1: dispatch (drains BOTH per-type queues; see §5)
        dispatch_ready();

        // Phase 2: completion
        WorkerCompletion c;
        while (completion_queue_.try_pop(c)) {
            on_task_complete(c);   // see §6
        }

        // If all three queues empty, block on a condition variable until
        // any producer signals work.
        wait_for_work();
    }
}
```

Phase order matters:

- Wiring before dispatch: a task may become ready during wiring (all its
  producers already completed); wiring promotes it to ready_queue in the
  same Scheduler iteration.
- Dispatch before completion: dispatch the backlog first to keep workers
  busy; completion handling is not time-critical (fanout release just
  queues more work for the next iteration).

---

## 4. Phase 0 — wiring

```cpp
void Scheduler::wire_fanout(const WiringEntry &w) {
    TaskSlot csid = w.consumer;
    TaskSlotState &c = slots_[csid];
    int32_t actual_live = 0;

    for (TaskSlot psid : w.producers) {
        TaskSlotState &p = slots_[psid];
        std::lock_guard lk(p.fanout_mu);
        // COMPLETED producers are already done; FAILED producers poison this
        // consumer instead of making it ready.
        if (p.state.load() == TaskState::COMPLETED ||
            p.state.load() == TaskState::CONSUMED) continue;
        if (p.state.load() == TaskState::FAILED) {
            poison_task(csid, p.failure_message);
            continue;
        }
        p.fanout_consumers.push_back(csid);
        p.fanout_total++;
        actual_live++;
    }

    // Update consumer's fanin to the actual live count (producers already
    // finished don't count).
    c.fanin_count = actual_live;
    if (actual_live == 0) {
        // Strict-4: wiring promotes directly to the per-type queue.
        auto *q = (c.worker_type == WorkerType::NEXT_LEVEL) ? ready_next_level_queue_
                                                            : ready_sub_queue_;
        q->push(csid);
    }
}
```

**Race with completion**: a producer may finish between submit and wiring.
The `lock_guard(p.fanout_mu)` + `p.state.load()` check ensures we either:

- wire an edge and the producer's future completion will fire `fanin_released++`
  for this consumer, or
- see "already completed" and skip, correctly counting this producer as not
  contributing to fanin.

---

## 5. Phase 1 — dispatch

`dispatch_ready` drains each per-type ready queue with its own
head-of-line break so one saturated pool cannot stall the other:

```cpp
void Scheduler::dispatch_ready() {
    auto drain_one = [&](ReadyQueue *q) {
        TaskSlot slot;
        while (q->try_pop(slot)) {
            TaskSlotState &s = slots_[slot];
            int N = s.group_size();  // 1 for single-task slots

            std::vector<WorkerThread *> workers;
            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
                WorkerThread *wt = nullptr;
                int32_t affinity = s.get_affinity(i);
                if (affinity >= 0) {
                    wt = (s.worker_type == WorkerType::NEXT_LEVEL)
                        ? manager_->get_worker_by_id(s.worker_type, affinity)
                        : manager_->get_worker_by_index(s.worker_type, affinity);
                    if (wt && (!wt->idle() || !s.worker_allowed(i, wt->worker_id())))
                        wt = nullptr;
                } else {
                    wt = manager_->pick_idle(
                        s.worker_type, workers, s.eligible_workers_for(i));
                }
                if (!wt) break;
                workers.push_back(wt);
            }
            if (static_cast<int>(workers.size()) < N) {
                q->push(slot);   // put back; try again after a completion
                break;
            }
            s.state.store(TaskState::RUNNING);
            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
                workers[i]->dispatch({slot, i});
            }
        }
    };
    drain_one(ready_next_level_queue_);
    drain_one(ready_sub_queue_);
}
```

Dispatch hands off a `WorkerDispatch {slot, group_index}` to a
`WorkerThread`. The WorkerThread reads
`ring.slot_state(slot).{callable, task_args, config}` on its own thread
and encodes it into the per-WT mailbox — see
[worker-manager.md](worker-manager.md) §3 for the dispatch protocol.

**Pick-idle back-pressure**: when the manager cannot provide enough idle
workers that also satisfy affinity and worker eligibility, the slot is
pushed back onto *its* queue and that queue's drain halts; the other-type
queue's drain continues. The ring's back-pressure at the Orch side already
caps the total number of in-flight tasks across both types.

Worker eligibility is opaque scheduling metadata. The Scheduler compares
worker ids and capability bits exposed through `WorkerEndpoint::caps()`, but
does not inspect HCOMM, RDMA, socket, or remote buffer internals.
For NEXT_LEVEL affinity, `s.get_affinity(i)` is a stable worker id and can
be different from the `next_level_threads_` vector index. SUB affinity is not
public and keeps the internal index semantics.

---

## 6. Phase 2 — completion

Called by `WorkerThread::on_complete_(completion)` which pushes to
`completion_queue_`. The Scheduler then:

```cpp
void Scheduler::on_task_complete(const WorkerCompletion &completion) {
    TaskSlot sid = completion.task_slot;
    TaskSlotState &s = slots_[sid];

    // Group tasks aggregate per-member outcomes before the slot is terminal.
    if (s.group_size > 0) {
        if (!record_group_member_completion(completion)) return;
    }

    bool failed = completion.outcome != EndpointOutcome::SUCCESS;
    s.state.store(failed ? TaskState::FAILED : TaskState::COMPLETED);

    // Release fanout refs on downstream consumers
    std::vector<TaskSlot> consumers;
    {
        std::lock_guard lk(s.fanout_mu);
        consumers = s.fanout_consumers;    // snapshot (mutex protects vector)
    }
    for (TaskSlot csid : consumers) {
        if (failed) {
            poison_task(csid, completion.error_message);
            continue;
        }
        TaskSlotState &c = slots_[csid];
        if (++c.fanin_released == c.fanin_count) {
            // Strict-4: push to the queue matching the *consumer's*
            // worker type. A consumer of a NEXT_LEVEL producer can itself
            // be SUB, so we pick based on `c.worker_type`, not `s`.
            auto *q = (c.worker_type == WorkerType::NEXT_LEVEL) ? ready_next_level_queue_
                                                                : ready_sub_queue_;
            q->push(csid);
        }
    }

    // Also: this task itself may now be CONSUMED
    try_consume(sid);
}
```

### `try_consume`

```cpp
void Scheduler::try_consume(TaskSlot sid) {
    TaskSlotState &s = slots_[sid];
    if (s.state.load() != TaskState::COMPLETED &&
        s.state.load() != TaskState::FAILED) return;
    if (s.fanout_released.load() != s.fanout_total) return;

    s.state.store(TaskState::CONSUMED);

    // Erase tensormap entries this task produced
    for (int i = 0; i < s.task_args.tensor_count(); i++) {
        // only erase entries still pointing at this slot
        uint64_t ptr = s.task_args.tensor(i).data;
        if (orchestrator_->tensormap_lookup(ptr) == sid)
            orchestrator_->tensormap_erase(ptr);
    }

    // Return slot to ring pool
    ring_->release(sid);
    s.state.store(TaskState::FREE);
}
```

Scope release (when `scope_end` runs) calls back into the Scheduler to bump
`fanout_released` by 1 on each scope-registered slot, triggering
`try_consume`. This is how leaf tasks get reclaimed.

---

## 7. Start / Stop

```cpp
void Scheduler::start(Config cfg) {
    manager_ = cfg.manager;
    orchestrator_ = cfg.orchestrator;
    running_.store(true);
    thread_ = std::thread([this] { run(); });
}

void Scheduler::stop() {
    running_.store(false);
    wake();
    thread_.join();
}
```

`Worker::init` calls `start` after all children are registered and
`WorkerManager::start` has spawned the WorkerThread pool.

---

## 8. Completion channel from WorkerThread

```cpp
// In WorkerThread, after endpoint->run() returns:
void WorkerThread::loop() {
    for (;;) {
        TaskSlot sid = queue_.pop();
        WorkerCompletion c = endpoint_->run(ring_, {sid, group_index});
        scheduler_->completion_queue_.push(c);   // notify Scheduler
    }
}
```

The completion path is one-way and asynchronous: the WorkerThread returns to
its own queue immediately, and the Scheduler handles completion in its own
loop. This keeps worker dispatch latency bounded by dispatch cost alone, not
by completion-handling cost.

---

## 9. Invariants

1. **Scheduler is single-threaded**: all three phase handlers run in the
   Scheduler's own thread. Atomics/mutexes on slot state are only needed for
   Orch/WorkerThread ↔ Scheduler coordination.
2. **Slot transitions are monotonic**: success follows
   `FREE → PENDING → READY → RUNNING → COMPLETED → CONSUMED`; failure follows
   `FREE → PENDING/READY/RUNNING → FAILED → CONSUMED`.
3. **Dispatch consumes one ready entry**: every `ready_queue.push` is
   matched by exactly one `pick_idle + dispatch`. Group tasks push once,
   dispatch N times via `pick_n_idle`.
4. **Completion is per-worker for groups**: `worker_done` is called
   `group_size` times; only the terminal aggregate pushes one slot completion.
   If any member fails, not-yet-dispatched members become skipped and already
   running members are allowed to finish.
5. **Failed producers poison consumers**: consumers of a failed producer move
   to `FAILED`, are never dispatched, and still run normal cleanup.
6. **`try_consume` is idempotent on CONSUMED**: a repeated call after
   CONSUMED is a no-op.
