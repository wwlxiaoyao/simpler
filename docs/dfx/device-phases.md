# Device-side phase timing — fixed AICPU phases + the variable-phase plan

The AICPU **cannot write the host log on its hot path** — logging perturbs the
very timing it would measure, and the AICore side has no log path at all.
Instead it **stamps raw `get_sys_cnt_aicpu()` cycles into a host-allocated
buffer**; the host reads the buffer back after stream-sync and converts cycles
→ ns. This is how `device_wall` has always worked; this doc describes the
generalization to a fixed set of phases, and the design for variable phases.

## Fixed phases (implemented)

The on-NPU portion of `simpler_run`'s blocking wait subdivides into a **small,
closed set** of phases, each of which fires **exactly once per run per AICPU
thread**. Because the cardinality is fixed, a plain indexed store suffices — no
ring, no rotation, no recycling. This is the same model the original single
run-wall `{start, end}` pair used, generalized to `N` pairs.

`enum class AicpuPhase` (`src/common/platform/include/common/device_phase.h`):

| Phase | Window |
| ----- | ------ |
| `RunWall` | whole-run AICPU wall (the legacy `device_wall`, slot 0) |
| `Preamble` | executor init + wait-for-init before orchestration |
| `SoLoad` | orchestration-SO `dlopen` (real cost only on a first/changed callable; ~0 when cached) |
| `GraphBuild` | `orchestrate()` — submit tasks (the scheduler dispatches concurrently). **A container** for the three prep sub-phases below plus the `OrchWindow`/`SchedWindow` work. |
| `ConfigValidate` | (inside `GraphBuild`, orch thread) `config_func()` + arg-count validate |
| `ArenaWire` | (inside `GraphBuild`, orch thread) attach the prebuilt runtime arena + wire device pointers |
| `SmReset` | (inside `GraphBuild`, orch thread) SM/ring reset + finalize + bind, up to releasing the scheduler threads |
| `PostOrch` | last-thread teardown after the run completes — a2a3 deinit invalidates host-DMA/SDMA-published state before reset; a5 resets scheduler state without cache invalidation. Stamped only on the thread that finishes last, so it is the real teardown tail, strictly after `sched`. |
| `OrchWindow` | orchestrator thread's submit window (the former device-log `orch_start/end`) |
| `SchedWindow` | scheduler thread's dispatch window (the former device-log `sched_start/end`) |

`ConfigValidate` / `ArenaWire` / `SmReset` break out the per-run prep the
orchestrator thread does **inside `GraphBuild`, before the `OrchWindow` opens**
(the scheduler threads spin-wait on `runtime_init_ready_` across this whole
region). Before they existed this was an unattributed front-matter gap — on a
qwen3-14B 3.5k decode step it is ~22 ms, ~31 % of the device wall. They are
stamped only on the orchestrator thread (sched threads leave the slots unset; the
host reducer ignores them).

`OrchWindow` / `SchedWindow` replace the device-log `Orch` / `Sched` lines for
everyday use: the orchestrator and each scheduler thread store their
already-measured window into the host buffer, the host reduces across threads
(`Sched` = `min(start)..max(end)` over the scheduler threads) and emits them as
markers. The verbose per-thread `orch_start=…` / `sched_start=…` / `Scheduler
summary` (loops, tasks_scheduled) device-log lines are gated behind
`SIMPLER_ORCH_PROFILING` / `SIMPLER_SCHED_PROFILING` (default off) as an opt-in
deep-dive — see [l2-timing.md](l2-timing.md).

### Buffer layout & flow

* Host allocates one `AicpuPhaseRecord[NUM_AICPU_PHASES]` per launched AICPU
  thread (**thread-major**), resets it each run, and publishes its address into
  the AICPU SO via `set_platform_phase_base()` — a plain global + `extern "C"`
  setter, exactly like `set_platform_dump_base` / `set_platform_l2_swimlane_base`
  (onboard: `kernel.cpp` from `KernelArgs::device_wall_data_base`; sim: the host
  dlsym's the setter). **No C++ `thread_local`** (per
  [dynamic-linking.md](../dynamic-linking.md)); the per-thread slot is resolved
  from `platform_aicpu_affinity_thread_idx()` (a pthread-key index).
* Each surviving AICPU thread stamps its **own** slots — plain stores, no
  atomics. `kernel.cpp` stamps `RunWall`; the inner `aicpu_execute` / scheduler
  stamp `Preamble`/`SoLoad`/`GraphBuild`/`PostOrch`/`OrchWindow`/`SchedWindow`
  via `get_platform_phase_base()` + the affinity index — no change to any
  `extern "C"` signature.
* Host reduces each phase across threads as `max(end) - min(start)` on readback
  (`DeviceRunnerBase::read_device_wall_ns`), caches per-phase ns
  (`last_device_phase_ns`), and emits each non-zero phase as a `clk=dev`
  `[STRACE]` marker nested under `simpler_run.runner_run.device_wall`
  (see [host-trace.md](host-trace.md)).

### Gating: `SIMPLER_DEVICE_STRACE_ENABLE` (host/device split)

The device markers can be turned off independently of the host spans so a
deployment can profile the two domains separately:

* **Device** (`clk=dev` markers): the runtime env `SIMPLER_DEVICE_STRACE_ENABLE`,
  read once by `emit_device_phase_markers` in the host `c_api_shared`. `=0`
  suppresses the whole device-phase emit; any other value (or unset) keeps it on
  (**default on**). It does not affect the on-device stamping cost (cheap plain
  stores) — only whether the host re-emits the readback as markers.
* **Host** (`simpler_run` / `bind` / `runner_run` / `validate` spans): no new
  knob — they ride the compile-time `SIMPLER_HOST_STRACE` macro and the log level
  (`LOG_INFO_V9`), so raising the log threshold drops them.

`RunWall` is the whole on-NPU wall (the former `RunTiming.device_wall`); it is
emitted as the `simpler_run.runner_run.device_wall` marker, not returned.

### Reading the phases — they nest and overlap, don't sum them

The phases are **not a flat partition** of the wall — they nest, and some run
concurrently. Use each span's `ts` (device-domain start offset) + `dur` to see
the structure, not the bare durations:

```text
device_wall (RunWall)                 ── time flows top → bottom (sequential) ──
│
├─ preamble                              init + wait-for-init
│
├─ graph_build  (CONTAINER):
│    │
│    ├─ config_validate   ┐
│    ├─ arena_wire        │  prep (sequential, orch thread)
│    ├─ sm_reset          ┘
│    │
│    └─ Effective         ← orch & sched run SIDE BY SIDE (concurrent):
│         ┌──── orch (OrchWindow) ────┐   ┌──── sched (SchedWindow) ────┐
│         │ orchestrator submits tasks│   │ scheduler dispatches/drains │
│         └───────────────────────────┘   └─────────────────────────────┘
│              (finishes first)                 (outlasts orch)
│
└─ post_orch                             last-thread teardown (deinit), after sched
```

The vertical axis is time: `preamble → graph_build → post_orch` are **sequential**
(top to bottom), and inside `graph_build` the prep phases are sequential too. Only
`orch` and `sched` are drawn **side by side** because they are **concurrent** — both
start when the schedulers are released, and `sched` outlasts `orch` (the scheduler
keeps dispatching after the orchestrator has submitted everything). `«Effective»`
is **not a stamped marker** — `orch` and `sched` are the two real spans, and
`strace_timing` derives `Effective = max(orch_end, sched_end) −
min(orch_start, sched_start)` (their merged window).

So:

* `device_wall ≈ preamble + graph_build + post_orch` (left-to-right, sequential
  — `post_orch` is the teardown tail after `graph_build` returns).
* `graph_build ≈ prep + Effective`, where `prep = config_validate + arena_wire +
  sm_reset` (sequential) and `Effective = orch ∪ sched` (the concurrent window).
  You **cannot** add `orch + sched` — they overlap; use their union `Effective`.
* `graph_build − Effective` ≈ `prep` — the front matter, now broken out. See
  [l2-timing.md](l2-timing.md) for how the rounds-table reports `Effective`.
* `post_orch` is stamped **only on the thread that finishes last** (gated on
  `finished_`), so it captures just the `deinit` teardown. (An earlier version
  stamped it on every thread; an orchestrator thread that finished submitting
  early then sat idle waiting for the scheduler, and the cross-thread
  `max(end) − min(start)` reduction absorbed that orch-waits-for-sched overlap
  into `post_orch` — inflating it to tens of ms. It is now the real teardown.)

**Worked example** — qwen3-14B, 3.5k-context **decode** step on a2a3 (per-step
means): `device_wall` ≈ 71 ms, of which `graph_build` ≈ 71 ms (the container),
`Effective` ≈ 49 ms (`orch` ≈ 25 ms started at +22 ms, `sched` ≈ 49 ms), so the
~22 ms before the windows open — `config_validate + arena_wire + sm_reset` — is a
fixed per-decode prep cost that is now directly visible instead of only inferable
as `graph_build − Effective`.

### Sim

Sim captures the same phases as onboard. `RunWall` comes from the host
`steady_clock` (the way sim has always measured `device_wall`); the finer
subdivisions (preamble / so_load / graph_build / post_orch + orch / sched) are
stamped by the AICPU threads inside the dlopen'd runtime SO, exactly as onboard.

Sim drives those threads through the basic affinity gate, which — unlike the
onboard filter gate — does not populate `platform_aicpu_affinity_thread_idx()`.
The executor resolves the thread's index anyway (via its own fallback counter)
and publishes it with `platform_aicpu_affinity_set_thread_idx()` before any
stamping, so the per-thread phase-record slot resolves correctly inside the SO.
A phase whose measured duration rounds to 0 (e.g. preamble / graph_build on a
trivial example) is simply not emitted.

## Variable phases (design, not yet implemented)

Phases entered an **unknown number of times** — per-submit, per-scheduler-loop,
arbitrary nesting — cannot use the fixed-slot buffer: there is no slot count
that bounds them, and the fixed buffer has **no rotation** (nobody recycles a
full buffer). These already have a home: the **L2 swimlane orch/sched pools**
(`L2SwimlaneAicpuOrchPhasePool` / `SchedPhasePool`), which carry a
`head + free_queue` ring that the host drains continuously. That is where
`l2_swimlane_aicpu_record_orch_phase` / `record_sched_phase` already write.

The two tracks split cleanly by **cardinality**, and that split also resolves
how each phase is tagged:

| aspect | fixed (this buffer) | variable (L2 swimlane pool) |
| ------ | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| cardinality | once per run per thread | many per run (loops / nesting) |
| storage | indexed slot, no rotation | ring with `head + free_queue` rotation |
| tag | a stable slot index → a small closed `AicpuPhase` enum is fine | append-only → no slot needed; use a compile-time `FNV-1a` hash of the call-site name literal so adding a phase is a one-line change with no central registry |

The variable track is intentionally left as a follow-up: a `name_hash`-tagged
RAII scope writing the swimlane ring, with the host recovering hash → name from
the orch SO's `.rodata` (or a dedicated section) so no hand-maintained map is
needed.

## Aligning host and device on one timeline (future)

Host spans use `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` ns; device phases use AICPU cycles. They are
reported in the same `[STRACE]` grammar (`clk=dev` marks the cycle-derived
durations). To place both on **one** Perfetto timeline later, the device side
would emit a periodic `clock.anchor` line pairing one `host_ns` with one
`dev_cyc` + `dev_freq`; the parser then maps device spans onto the host axis.
The marker `v=` field and `k=v` extensibility reserve room for this — it is not
part of the current host-only work.
