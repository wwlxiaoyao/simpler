# Remote L3 PR Split and Audit Artifacts

This file records the pre-split audit artifacts for the remote L3 worker stack.
It follows `pr-split-and-audit-plan.md` and stops before child branch creation.

### Worktree Status

Tracked local changes after Phase 3 audit fixes:

| Path | Status | Notes |
| ---- | ------ | ----- |
| `docs/remote-l3-worker-design.md` | Modified | Adds a link to `pr-split-and-audit-plan.md`; pre-existing audit/doc change |
| `src/common/hierarchical/remote_wire.cpp` | Modified | Phase 3 fix: include `enable_scope_stats` in `CallConfigWire v1` encode/decode |
| `python/simpler/remote_l3_protocol.py` | Modified | Phase 3 fix: decode `enable_scope_stats` from TASK payloads |
| `tests/ut/cpp/hierarchical/test_remote_wire.cpp` | Modified | Phase 3 regression coverage for `enable_scope_stats` TASK round trip |
| `tests/ut/py/test_task_interface.py` | Modified | Phase 3 regression coverage for Python TASK decode of `enable_scope_stats` |
| `tests/ut/py/test_callable_identity.py` | Modified | Phase 3 coverage for `PYTHON_SERIALIZED` and `STAGED_BLOB` unsupported negotiation paths |

Untracked files existed before this artifact was created. They are preserved
unless later audit work explicitly needs one of them.

### Stop Point

This audit has completed Phases 0 through 3 and intentionally stops before
Phase 4 child branch creation / PR split execution. No child PR branches have
been created by this audit.

## Phase 3 Drift Fixes

| Item | Finding | Fix | Verification |
| ---- | ------- | --- | ------------ |
| `CallConfigWire.enable_scope_stats` | `protocol.md` requires the field, but C++ omitted it and Python decoded it as `False` | Updated C++ encode/decode and Python decode; added C++ and Python round-trip tests | `test_remote_wire`; targeted Python protocol test |
| `PYTHON_SERIALIZED` unsupported behavior | Implementation rejected it, but coverage was missing | Added direct `_prepare_register_callable` negative test | targeted Python callable identity test |
| `STAGED_BLOB` unsupported behavior | Implementation rejected it, but coverage was missing | Added direct inner `CHIP_CALLABLE` staged-blob negative test | targeted Python callable identity test |

## Risk Register

| Risk | Location | Failure mode | Mitigation | Test |
| ---- | -------- | ------------ | ---------- | ---- |
| Protocol drift between C++ endpoint and Python session | `remote_wire.cpp`, `remote_l3_protocol.py`, `protocol.md` | Remote TASK decode shifts fields or drops config flags | Keep PR 3 protocol-first; add round-trip tests for every `CallConfigWire` field | Phase 3 `enable_scope_stats` tests; `test_remote_wire` |
| Partial remote registration cleanup | `Worker._post_start_register_remote`, remote prepare/commit/abort controls | Some endpoints commit while others fail, leaving stale registry state | Preserve prepare/commit/abort/tombstone design; review cleanup-uncertain guard in PR 6 | post-init register/unregister tests; add failure injection in PR 6 |
| Endpoint failure poisoning | `scheduler.cpp`, `remote_endpoint.cpp`, `remote_l3_session.py` | Failed producer or dead endpoint lets consumers dispatch with stale data | First-error-wins, dependency poisoning, health/process-exit failures | scheduler failed producer; remote sim process-exit and failed-dependency tests |
| Remote buffer lifetime | `worker.py`, `task_interface.py`, `remote_l3_session.py` | Owner freed while imported/slot-ref still active | Slot refs, import refs, pending free/release queues | owner-free/import-release and slot-ref-deferred free tests |
| Hidden sidecar integrity | `task_interface.py`, `orchestrator.cpp`, `remote_endpoint.cpp` | Bare host pointer or mismatched descriptor count reaches remote worker | Python sidecar storage, C++ validation, remote endpoint fail-fast | sidecar unit tests, bare host pointer endpoint failure |
| Future controls accidentally treated as supported | `remote_l3_session.py`, HCOMM docs | Reviewer believes CommDomain/HCOMM or serialized/staged paths are ready | Explicit unsupported tests and Future Work list | Phase 3 serialized/staged tests; add CommDomain negative |
| Verification build environment | `tests/ut/cpp/build` | System GoogleTest ABI mismatch blocks C++ UT link | Use `tests/ut/cpp/build-fetch` or rebuild system gtest per troubleshooting doc | Current run log records fallback |

## Per-PR Verification Checklist

| PR | Verification |

| PR 2 Callable Identity | Python UT for descriptor hashing, opaque handles, local registration/unregistration, forged/mutated handle rejection |
| PR 3 Protocol | C++ `test_remote_wire`; Python protocol decode/materialization tests; verify no POD memcpy in remote wire |
| PR 4 Scheduler / Eligibility | C++ `test_orchestrator` and `test_scheduler`; negative tests for remote sidecar/local endpoint and null remote OUTPUT |
